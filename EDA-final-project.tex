\section{Rationale and Research
Questions}\label{rationale-and-research-questions}}

The maintenance of healthy and functioning water systems is critical not
just to human life, but also to the survival of countless other species
and their interconnected ecosystems. We are only beginning to understand
the impact of human action on water bodies. Conductivity, or the ability
of water to pass an electrical current via dissolved salts and other
minerals, is a strong indicator of salinity, a key component of water
quality. Changes in conductivity over time suggest a potential pollutant
entering the system.

For this study, we chose to analyze how specific conductance can vary
depending on the season. In particular, we wanted to address the impact
of winterizing the roadways with salt on water quality. Our main
research question was: is salting the roads a main driver in changes to
water conductivity, or are other minerals a significant factor? Here, we
chose to analyze the Neuse River in Kinston, North Carolina over a 46
year period (1976-2022) (???, check on this bc of the NAs). We chose
this river due to familiarity with the data and its proximity to an
urban center (Kinston pop = 20,398). We also know from living in the
headwaters of this river that salt is applied to roadways in the upper
watershed in the winter (albeit infrequently). The gage at Kinston is
much farther down the river than we know salting occurs, so we are
really examining if there are significant downstream effects of road
salting. ADD MORE?

We used the following research questions to guide our work:
\textgreater{} 1. How does specific conductance vary seasonally?
\textgreater{} 2. Is calcium, magnesium, or sodium the driver of
specific conductance? \textgreater{} 3. What is the likely specific
conductance in the future (forcasting trends)?

\section{Dataset Information}\label{dataset-information}}

Neuse River water quality and discharge data at Kinston, North Carolina.
The gage information comes from the United States Geologic Survey (USGS)
National Water Information Systems (NWIS) database. USGS gage stations
typically collect discharge and a subset collect water quality data.
This water quality data may include nutrient concentrations,
concentrations of chlorophyll a, specific conductivity, and
concentrations of certain ions. Since seasonal salinity trends and their
potential sources are the focus of this study, the water quality data
being examined includes specific conductivity and concentrations of
calcium, magnesium, and sodium in the water column. Specific
conductivity will be used as a proxy for salinization, and the relative
amounts of each salt ion will be examined in the hopes of identifying a
potential source of any seasonal salinity increases, in particular the
contribution of road salts to salinization.

To obtain both sets of data,the dataRetrieval package was used to
connect directly to the NWIS database and pull water quality and
discharge data without needing to download it first. Both sets of data
are pulled starting in 1976 and end at the most recent data point in the
database in 2022.

\section{Exploratory Analysis}\label{exploratory-analysis}}

The first step we took in our initial exploratory analysis was to
wrangle the water quality (WQ) dataset to include only the columns of
interest. This included the sampling dates and concentrations for
specific conductance, calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), and magnesium (Mg),
which were each given separate columns. This dataset contains monthly
observations, however, not necessarily sampled on the first of each
month. We wrangled the WQ dataset to round the dates to the first of the
month to ensure that there are evenly spaced time steps across the
years, a necessary condition for time series analyses.

We plotted the specific conductance over time to visualize any gaps in
our dataset. We see that the WQ dataset contains many long periods of
missing data for specific conductance. Since these missing periods
frequently span across many years, we chose to look at WQ data from 2013
through 2021. There are no missing data points from this period of time,
and will therefore not require any interpolation of this dataset.

\end{figure}

We are also interested in the flow of the Neuse River because this
factor may affect salinity. For example, higher discharges may dilute
any salinity and drier periods may reflect higher salt content. We
started by wrangling the flow dataset to include the parameters of
interest, sampling date and discharge.

\subsection{Question 1: How does specific conductance vary
seasonally?}\label{question-1-how-does-specific-conductance-vary-seasonally}}

After running a seasonal MannKendall test, we have determined that for
the Nuese river there is no significant seasonality component for
conductivity nor any of the salt ions. Looking at the time series
decomposition, we can see that there is a discernable seasonality
component, but it is very very small relative to the overall data.
Similarly, there is no significant trend over the study period either
(see p-values in table 2 below), indicating that over our examination
period there is some degree of stationarity with regard to the salinity
levels in the Neuse at Kinston. We can conclude that there is some
seasonality in flow data, not a ton of difference depending on the
season, but there is a significant trend of increasing flow year after
year (p = 3.368e-07). This increasing trend in flow may be masking
increases in salt content in the river, as increased flow will dilute an
increased salt content to the same concentration, hiding an increase in
salt deposition to the river.

When plotted by the day of the year (DOY), we can see that there isn't
much of a correlation between each specific conductivity or salt
concentration over the year. Higher specific conductivity is correlated
with higher concentrations of each salt, which is expected (more salt
ions = higher salinity), but there is no discernible pattern related to
the DOY. This corroborates our time series analysis that there is not a
significant seasonal component the salinity of the Neuse at Kinston.

While there isn't much seasonality in the specific conductance found at
this site in the Neuse, the salt ions measured there can still be
examined to see if one or another appears to be driving the
conductivity. It appears as though sodium is the ion most closely
associated with the specific conductivity found at this site, as this
ion both most closely aligns with the patterns seen in the data and also
is the most abundant ion.

\hypertarget{summary-and-conclusions}{%
\section{Summary and Conclusions}\label{summary-and-conclusions}}

The Neuse River at Kinston does not show strong seasonality in salinity
and appears to show stationarity in salinity levels over the study
period. Specific conductance, the proxy used to examine salinity, showed
marginal seasonal trends when examined with a time series decomposition
and no discernible pattern when plotted by the day of the year.
Discharge similarly shows some marginal seasonality, but also shows a
slight increasing trend. This slight increasing trend is interesting
because it could hide a similarly-scaled increase in salinity over the
same time period, as increased discharge would dilute more salinity
effectively.

Sodium appears to have the strongest impact on specific conductance,
indicating that it perhaps is the main driver of the salinity that does
exist in the Neuse River. Sodium is the most abundant ion in the water,
magnesium and calcium had a much lower concentration. Sodium also
appears to have a nearly 1:1 correlation with specific conductivity, as
seen in the DOY plot where they are plotted against each other.

Overall, this is good news for the Neuse, indicating that at Kinston,
which is relatively far down the watershed, upstream uses of salts do
not cause seasonal changes in the river. The location of Kinston in the
watershed has been brought up in this analysis multiple times because it
is significant. This gage site is potentially far enough downstream from
where road salt would be used to have the salinity be insignificant by
the time the water reached Kinston. This gage was chosen in oart because
it actually measures the salinity data we were interested in (and in
part because we knew it was a pretty good dataset), but a future study
would be interesting to compare the data at Kinston to similarly
collected data at a gage site further upstream, like at Clayton, which
is relatively close to the major metro area around Raleigh where road
salt is also likely to be more prevalent than in smaller population
areas.
