Final Project Repository for Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872L) at Duke University, Spring 2022

Summary
<This repository contains all our data, analysis, and writeup surrounding our research questions- does specific conductance of the Nuese River in Kinston, North Carolina vary seasonally? And what are the specific drivers for specific conductance, calcium, magnesium or sodium? The repository contains all of our data, both raw and processed to a usable format. We pulled both discharge and water quality data from United States Geologic Survey (USGS) National Water information system (NWIS) for gage 02089500 between the years 1976 to 2022.>
